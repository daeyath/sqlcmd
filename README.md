# sqlcmd

After my job is finished at the end of 2022 I will replace my smartphone as a means to practice my programming skills including SQL. And then I haven't found sqlite with command prompt in Google play store. So I made it so it can be used on Android smartphones for my hobby. sqlcmd is not similar to Microsoft SQL Server's sqlcmd, it's just a personal or hobby project.

Run `g++ -o sqlcmd sqlite3.cxx` to compile source code and then run `./sqlcmd` in your favorite shell.

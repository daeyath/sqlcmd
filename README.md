# sqlcmd

I haven't found sqlite with command prompt in Google play store.  So I made it so it can be used on Android smartphones.

sqlcmd is not similar to Microsoft SQL Server's sqlcmd, it's just a personal or hobby project.

Run the command `g++ -o sqlcmd sqlite3.cxx` and then run the command `./sqlcmd`
